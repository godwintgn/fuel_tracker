# FuelTrack Pro — AI Agent Context

> **Purpose:** Cross-reference this file at the start of new Cursor/agent sessions to avoid confusion about what exists, what’s pending, and how the project is organized.  
> **Original spec:** [`fueltrack-pro-cursor-prompt.md`](fueltrack-pro-cursor-prompt.md)  
> **Mockups:** [`stitch_fueltrack_pro_analytics_app/`](stitch_fueltrack_pro_analytics_app/) (HTML + PNG + `DESIGN.md`)  
> **GitHub:** https://github.com/godwintgn/fuel_tracker  
> **Flutter app root:** `fueltrack_pro/`

## 4. Build order — progress

Incremental build per original prompt. **Do not generate everything at once.**

| Step | Status | Summary |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | ✅ Done | Scaffold, M3 theme, SQLite schema (`vehicles`, `refuel_entries`, `settings`) |
| 2 | ✅ Done | Onboarding (4 screens, Skip on each), persistence |
| 3 | ✅ Done | Vehicle list, add/edit, empty state, selected vehicle in settings |
| 4 | ✅ Done | Dashboard, charts, FAB speed-dial, **dev seed data** |
| 5 | ✅ Done | Refuel Entry + smart quantity/price/total calculation |
| 6 | ✅ Done | History (search, filters, swipe edit/delete) |
| 7 | ✅ Done | Analytics (charts, insight cards, period selector) |
| 8 | ⏳ Next | Settings + Google Drive backup |
| 9 | Pending | Wire end-to-end, **remove seed data** |

## 5. What is implemented (detail)

### 5.1 Database (`lib/services/database_service.dart`)

- **vehicles** — name, make, model, year, fuel_type, license_plate, notes, timestamps  
- **refuel_entries** — vehicle_id FK, date, odometer, quantity, price_per_liter, total_price, fuel_type, station_name, notes  
- **settings** — single row (id=1): currency, units, theme_mode, onboarding_completed, selected_vehicle_id  

### 5.2 Onboarding (`lib/screens/onboarding/`)

1. Welcome → 2. Add Vehicle → 3. Region & Currency → 4. Done  
- Skip on every step completes onboarding (may skip saving vehicle).  
- `onboarding_completed` in settings gates `app.dart` → `OnboardingFlow` vs `HomeShell`.

### 5.3 Main shell (`lib/screens/home/home_shell.dart`)

Bottom nav (4 tabs):

| Index | Tab | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| 0 | Dashboard | ✅ Live |
| 1 | Vehicles | ✅ Live |
| 2 | History | ✅ Live |
| 3 | Analytics | ✅ Live |

- **FAB speed-dial** on Dashboard (0) and History (2): New Refuel / New Vehicle + scrim.  
- Vehicles tab uses simple `+` FAB to add vehicle.

### 5.4 Dashboard (`lib/screens/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`)

- Vehicle selector in header  
- Hero: odometer, avg km/L + trend %  
- Quick overview: spend/liters/fill-ups (30d), cost/km  
- Last refuel card  
- Monthly spend bar chart, efficiency trend line chart (`fl_chart`)  
- Data via `dashboardProvider` → `DashboardStats` + `FuelCalculations`

### 5.5 Vehicle management (`lib/screens/vehicles/`)

- List with `VehicleCard`, empty state, add-another dashed card  
- Add/Edit form; delete blocked if refuel history exists  
- **Fuel Log** opens `AddRefuelScreen` for that vehicle  

### 5.6 Refuel entry (`lib/screens/refuel/add_refuel_screen.dart`)

- Form: date/time, vehicle, odometer, quantity, price/L, total, station, notes  
- **Smart calc:** any 2 of quantity / price-per-liter / total → derives third (`refuel_calculation.dart`)  
- Auto-calc fields highlighted with green tint + “AUTO” badge on total  
- Prefills price/L from last refuel; odometer hint from last reading  
- Soft warning if odometer &lt; previous refuel  
- Wired: speed-dial **New Refuel**, vehicle **Fuel Log**; invalidates `dashboardProvider` on save  
- `refuelsProvider.updateEntry` added for Step 6 edit flow  
- `refuelsProvider.deleteEntry` for history swipe-delete  

### 5.7 History (`lib/screens/history/history_screen.dart`)

- Search bar (stations, fuel type, vehicle name, notes)  
- Filter bottom sheet: vehicle, fuel type, date range (7d / 30d / 3mo / custom)  
- Summary chip: entry count + total spend for active filters  
- `RefuelHistoryCard` list matching mockup layout  
- Swipe right → edit (`AddRefuelScreen` edit mode); swipe left → delete with confirm  
- Tap card → edit; empty states for no data / no matches  
- Speed-dial **New Refuel** still available on History tab  

### 5.8 Analytics (`lib/screens/analytics/analytics_screen.dart`)

- Period selector: weekly / monthly / yearly  
- Efficiency line chart with peak km/L badge  
- Insight cards: efficiency change %, cost per km  
- Monthly spending bar chart (last 3 months)  
- Vehicle fuel-share pie chart + period summary metrics  
- Per-vehicle profile cards (avg km/L)  
- `AnalyticsService` + `analyticsProvider`; empty states when no refuels  

### 5.9 Dev seed data (`lib/services/seed_data_service.dart`)

**Important:** Runs only when **no refuel entries** exist in DB.

- Vehicle: Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Diesel, plate ABC-1234  
- Currency: OMR, km, liters  
- 8 refuels over ~3 months, odometer 41,200 → 45,230  
- **Must be removed in Step 9** before final release wiring.

### 5.10 Fuel efficiency logic (`lib/services/fuel_calculations.dart`)

- **km/L** = distance between consecutive refuels (odometer delta) ÷ liters at later refuel  
- **L/100km** = (liters ÷ km) × 100  
- **Cost per km** = total fuel cost ÷ total distance over period  
- Monthly spending aggregation for charts  

---

## 6. Design system

Colors and typography from `stitch_fueltrack_pro_analytics_app/fueltrack_pro/DESIGN.md`:

- **Green** (`#0D631B` primary) — efficiency  
- **Blue** (`#005FAF` secondary) — financial  
- Theme: `lib/theme/app_colors.dart`, `app_theme.dart`, `app_spacing.dart`  
- App icon: `assets/icon/app_icon.png` + `flutter_launcher_icons`  

### Known mockup fallbacks (user accepted)

| Mockup | Flutter fallback |
|--------|------------------|
| Roboto Flex variable axes | Standard Google Fonts weights |
| Material Symbols | `Icons.*` |
| Vehicle/station photos | Gradient + icon placeholders |
| Dark card gradients | Flat M3 surfaces |
| Confetti on onboarding done | Static success illustration |
| Tank capacity / maintenance alerts on add vehicle | Omitted (not in DB) |
| Efficiency format picker (L/100km, km/L, MPG) on region screen | Omitted for now |

---

## 7. Android signing & Play Console

### Release signing

- Keystore copied from **Wealth Journal**: `C:\Users\Dell\Documents\Github\Assets\wealth_journal\`  
- Files (gitignored): `android/key.properties`, `android/app/melmidalam-release.jks`  
- Config: `android/app/build.gradle.kts` loads `key.properties` for `release` builds  

### Fingerprints (release keystore, alias `key0`)

| Type | Value |
|------|--------|
| SHA-256 | `C8:9A:3B:5F:C0:A3:85:46:18:58:09:4B:56:5F:7F:A3:17:0E:01:19:F6:A1:39:22:C4:40:B8:04:1C:69:9A:44` |
| SHA-1 | `FF:47:7D:10:BC:08:E6:89:A7:E7:17:ED:AC:1E:5D:08:8C:E1:44:07` |

Use SHA-1 when adding `com.fuel.tracker` to Google Cloud OAuth (Drive backup, Step 8).

### Play package ownership verification

- File: `android/app/src/main/assets/adi-registration.properties`  
- Contains account-specific snippet from Play Console  
- APK path for upload: `fueltrack_pro/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`  
- **Can delete** `adi-registration.properties` after ownership is verified  

---

## 8. Agent workflow rules

Both rules are **alwaysApply: true** in `.cursor/rules/`:

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `commit-push-build-apk.mdc` | Bump version → analyze/test → commit → push → clean release APK |
| `update-agent-context.mdc` | Update **this file** after every substantive change (version, steps, providers, commits, next work) |

After substantive code changes:

1. Bump `pubspec.yaml` version (`+build` must increase for installs)  
2. `flutter analyze` (+ `flutter test` when logic changes)  
3. **Update `AGENT_CONTEXT.md`** (see `update-agent-context.mdc`)  
4. Commit (Conventional Commits)  
5. `git push origin master`  
6. Clean release APK:
   ```bash
   cd fueltrack_pro
   flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build apk --release
   ```

**Never commit:** `key.properties`, `*.jks`, `*.p12`, passwords.

**User rule:** Only commit when user asks — but user also requested this auto workflow rule; follow the rule for feature work unless user says “don’t commit.”

---

## 9. Git commit history (high level)

| Commit | Message |
|--------|---------|
| `d72fe72` | Initial scaffold + theme + SQLite |
| `6320907` | App icon, onboarding, release workflow rule |
| `acca27b` | Vehicle management + nav shell |
| `94cb08c` | Package `com.fuel.tracker` |
| `f18a120` | Play ownership `adi-registration.properties` |
| `55fd3c0` | Dashboard, charts, seed data, FAB speed-dial |
| `c304c33` | AGENT_CONTEXT rule + handoff doc |
| `b2a3c59` | Refuel entry screen + smart calculation |
| `cd04522` | History list, filters, swipe edit/delete |
| (pending) | Analytics screen + charts + insight cards |

---

## 10. Riverpod providers (quick map)

| Provider | Role |
|----------|------|
| `databaseServiceProvider` | SQLite singleton |
| `databaseInitProvider` | Await DB open |
| `settingsProvider` | App settings row |
| `vehiclesProvider` | CRUD list |
| `refuelsProvider` | All refuel entries |
| `onboardingDraftProvider` | Transient onboarding form state |
| `dashboardProvider` | Seed if empty + stats for selected vehicle |
| `analyticsProvider` | Fleet analytics for period (weekly/monthly/yearly) |
| `analyticsPeriodProvider` | Selected analytics timeframe |

---

## 11. Screens & navigation flow

```
main.dart → ProviderScope → FuelTrackApp (app.dart)
    │
    ├─ settings.onboarding_completed == false → OnboardingFlow (PageView)
    │
    └─ true → HomeShell
            ├─ [0] DashboardScreen
            ├─ [1] VehicleListScreen
            ├─ [2] HistoryScreen
            └─ [3] AnalyticsScreen
```

Add/Edit vehicle: pushed route from list or speed-dial.  
Add refuel: `AddRefuelScreen` from speed-dial or vehicle **Fuel Log**.  
Edit refuel: swipe right or tap card in History.

---

## 12. Next work (Step 8+)

### Step 8 — Settings + Google Drive (immediate next)

- Mirror Wealth Journal backup pattern  
- OAuth client for `com.fuel.tracker` + release SHA-1  
- CSV export  

### Step 9 — Final wiring

- Remove `SeedDataService` / stop calling `seedIfEmpty()`  
- Remove `adi-registration.properties` if Play verified  
- Real data only; polish mockup gaps  

---

## 13. Testing notes

- Widget tests mock Riverpod providers (no SQLite in test env).  
- `test/widget_test.dart` — expects Dashboard “Quick Overview” with overridden `dashboardProvider`.  
- `test/refuel_calculation_test.dart` — unit tests for smart refuel math (all 3 derive paths).  
- `test/refuel_history_filter_test.dart` — filter/search/date-range unit tests.  
- `test/analytics_service_test.dart` — period filter, fuel share, monthly spend.  
- Use `pump()` + short delay, not always `pumpAndSettle()` (can timeout on async DB).

## 16. How to use this file in a new session

Tell the agent:

> Read `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` and `fueltrack-pro-cursor-prompt.md`, then continue from **Step N**.

Or attach:

```
@AGENT_CONTEXT.md @fueltrack-pro-cursor-prompt.md
```

**Do not** re-scaffold the project or change package name / DB / state library without explicit user request.
